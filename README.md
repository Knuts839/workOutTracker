I have successfully created the backend code for the workout tracker. I used the following node packages express, morgen, and Mongoose to create this application. This application has been successfully deployed to Mongo Atlas and Heroku. You can add workouts to the database and they will populate the dashboard. The files in the document I found most helpful for writing the backend code were the exercise.js for my model workouts.js. The front end file that was most helpful for my routes was api.js. Thanks to my instructional stafft and the office hour got resurrance and assistance that my routes were working.
