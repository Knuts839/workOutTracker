This is a fitness tracking application. This application stores userâ€™s workouts in MongoAtlas. Technologies used: are node.js, express, the route logger morgan (generates 200, 300, 400, or 500 codes), and Mongoose for the non-relational database.

I used the following technologies:  express, morgan, and Mongoose to create this application. This application has been successfully deployed to Mongo Atlas and Heroku. The user can add workouts to the database, and they will populate the dashboard.
